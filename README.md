# piazzai.github.io

These are the source files of my personal website, built using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), the [Open Color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) library, and the [Fira Sans](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/) typeface. The layout is based on Bootstrap's [Cover theme](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/cover/). I use this site to link my online profiles, host my CV, and occasionally, distribute course materials.

Because of its inclusion in a fork network, this repository was lucky enough to be added to the 2020 GitHub snapshot for the [Arctic Code Vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault) program. While I am happy that this small description of myself will be preserved forever, I apologize to future archeologists for the waste of time and space.
